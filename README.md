# Simple_and_modern_GUI_CRUD
Create, Read, Update, and Delete
my first python project
# a brief explanation
this is an application that uses a single file python, by using the tkinter and typing libraries

in the code, I separate the code for the backend and frontend, the frontend where the frontend is composed by functions which when pressed will be called the function 

attention: you need to change the directory address, so there are no read errors
